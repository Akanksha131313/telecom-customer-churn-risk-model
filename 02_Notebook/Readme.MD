**Telecom Customer Churn Prediction -**

• Goal: Identify high-risk customers and key churn drivers to reduce revenue loss and improve retention strategies.

• Tech Stack: Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, Pipeline, preprocessing, metrics).

-> What I Did:

• Cleaned & preprocessed telecom dataset.

• Encoded categorical features and scaled numeric data.

• Built a Logistic Regression pipeline with class imbalance handling.

• Evaluated model using accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score.

• Visualized churn distribution, tenure, feature correlation, confusion matrix, ROC curve.

• Identified top churn drivers (OnlineSecurity, Contract type, MonthlyCharges).

-> **Key Insights:**

• hurn rate ~20% → revenue risk.

• Short-tenure customers most likely to churn.

• Top features inform targeted retention strategies.

-> **Next Steps:**

• Try ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost).

• Feature engineering combining tenure & service usage.

• Implement targeted retention campaigns.

• Monitor model performance over time.

-> **Impact:** Provides data-driven insights for business decisions, helping telecom companies retain high-risk customers and reduce revenue loss.
