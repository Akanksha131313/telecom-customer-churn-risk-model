-> This folder contains the **core Python modules** for the Telecom Customer Churn Prediction project:

- **01_data_preprocessing.py** → Handles data loading, cleaning, encoding, and train-test splitting.  
- **02_model_evaluation.py** → Provides reusable evaluation metrics: accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix (visual + numeric).  
- **03_model_training.py** → Implements logistic regression pipeline, integrates preprocessing, training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

**Purpose:**  
Enable **modular, end-to-end workflow** for churn prediction. Each module is reusable, ATS-friendly, and optimized for recruiter scan. Supports **business impact-driven insights**, not just technical outputs.
